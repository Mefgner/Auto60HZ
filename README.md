# Auto60HZ
## This small utility will automatically switch refresh rate of your screen you have chosen when you plug off your charger and sets it back when you plug it in

## Quick start
Before of all, **set your own settings** inside config.json (Do it before installing, because the file will be inserted inside .exe).
> If you have troubles with downrating refresh rate press _right_shift + backspace_ to set to default your screen settings and close program.

You can use installer.bat to install the program(also will add program to auto startup).
> You need to have installed python on your pc localy to build the program
